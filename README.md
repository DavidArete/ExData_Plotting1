I set the working directory to a directory on my own computer. I understand that as part of this evaluation you are not meant to run the code but if one were to do this the direcectory would be re-created on the user's machine and the zip file downloaded and placed in the same folder.

I did not download the zip programatically as this was not requested.

I know that my code is not very elegant - sometimes i take a few lines to do what I should be able to do with 1 line. I think this is typical of the extensive trial and error to get the code working. 

I confirm this is my own work.
